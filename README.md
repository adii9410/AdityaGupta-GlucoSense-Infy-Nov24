# Identification of Diabetes in a person based on healthcare statistics.

## üìã Project Overview
This project aims to build a reliable classification model to predict the presence of diabetes based on a range of symptoms and demographic factors. The dataset includes various features like
 age, gender, and symptoms such as Polyuria, Polydipsia, Weakness, and more.

The project involves data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
and the development of machine learning models to classify whether an individual is diabetic or not.

## üìä Key Insights from EDA
- Most Important Symptoms: Polyuria and Polydipsia were identified as the strongest predictors of diabetes.
- Age & Gender Patterns: Diabetes is more prevalent in males aged 40-60 and females aged 30-60.
- Correlation Analysis: Strong co-occurrence between Polyuria and Polydipsia, whereas Weakness showed weaker correlation with diabetes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for building and evaluating machine learning models

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Virtual environment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adii9410/AdityaGupta-GlucoSense-Infy-Nov24
    cd diabetes-classification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

<!-- ### Running the Project
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open `diabetes_classification.ipynb` to view the EDA and model training process. -->

<!-- ## üìà Models Used
- Logistic Regression for baseline performance
- Random Forest and XGBoost for improved accuracy
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for potential margin-based classification

## üß™ Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

The best-performing model will be selected based on these metrics. -->

## üìù Future Work
. Web Application Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive web-based tool that can be used by healthcare professionals or patients for real-time diabetes risk prediction.
. Feature Engineering: Investigate additional features such as family history, diet, and lifestyle factors to enhance prediction accuracy.
. Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilize Grid Search or Randomized Search techniques to fine-tune hyperparameters and further improve model performance.
. Model Ensemble: Implement ensemble techniques such as Stacking or Bagging to combine multiple models and improve robustness.
. Model Interpretability: Use SHAP or LIME to provide explanations for individual predictions, making the model more transparent and understandable.
